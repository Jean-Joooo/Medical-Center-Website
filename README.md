What I mainly used to create this website :

• HTML: Providing the structure for the web pages.

• CSS: Styling the elements and enhancing the visual appeal.

• Bootstrap: Using for both responsiveness and design.

• JavaScript & jQuery: Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

• Shuffle.js: Enabling smooth and responsive functionalities for filtering of content and interactivity.

• Netlify: Handling form submissions seamlessly.

• Font Awesome: Enhancing the user interface with scalable vector icons.

• Gtranslate: Integrating language translation capabilities for a global audience.

• Dall-e: Creating health professionals avatars.

• SEO: Setting up good SEO practices.
